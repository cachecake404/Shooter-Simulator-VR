# Shooter-Simulator-VR

This is a simulation in VR created specifically for the Oculus Rift and Quest that helps students prepare on what actions to take during school shootings.
There are two primary types of players - Students and Teacher.

Everytime a game begins a new multiplayer room is created with a school like enviornment. 
The only person who can make these rooms is a teacher who needs credentials so as to prevent misuse.

The teacher makes this room without a VR headset and plays on a their desktop with a normal monitor like a classical FPS.
One teacher can make one room and one room can only have one teacher.

Now students can join these rooms created by the teachers and they use a VR headset (Oculus Quest or Oculus Rift) to join. 
The teacher acts as the shooter and instructs the students on what to do based on the situation.

Student can interact with other students and move objects like chairs and use them as objects to jump on to then jump out of windows etc.

The student wins if they can escape the school grounds or survive long enough.
